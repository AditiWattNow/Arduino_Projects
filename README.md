# Arduino Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Arduino projects developed as part of my learning journey in Embedded Systems. Each project demonstrates a specific concept such as LED control, analog input handling using a potentiometer, and basic decision-making using voltage ranges.

## Projects Included:

1. **LED  Blink**  
   A simple simulation three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green).

2. **Potentiometer LED Dimmer**  
   Adjusting the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer through PWM control.

3. **Potentiometer LED Color Range Indicator**  
   Lighting up different LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) based on the voltage range from a potentiometer.
   
4. 2_servo_joystick

5. **tilt_switch_LEDs**

6. **servo_angle_photoresistor**

7. **joystick**

8. **PhotoResister_LEDs**

9. **buzzer_tone**

10. **LED_Dimmer_PushButton_Buzzer**

11. **led_toggle_button**

12. **Colour_mixing_using_RGB_LED**
    
13. **temperature_sensor**

14. **hex_binary_converter**

15. **Shift_Bytes_LEDs**
    -right shift
    -left shift
    -circular right shift
    -circular left shift

## Purpose:

- To practice basic Arduino coding concepts.
- To build a foundation for more complex embedded systems and IoT projects.
- To document the learning process for personal growth and professional opportunities like MEXT Scholarships and technical internships.
